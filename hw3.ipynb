    "## Homework 3: ``openpyxl``\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Excel is a powerful tool, not as powerful as R or Python, but it will *always* have its place in the world of business. That is why I am taking a spreadsheet modelling class this semester (Management Science with Professor Roumani, great class). During my internship rotations with FCA, I found myself always deep in a spreadsheet of some kind or another. Last summer I even integrated some VBA automation into a weekly filing to make my manager's life easier after I left. When I return to FCA in July, I'm sure it will be much of the same story; however, I would like to integrate a more advanced tool with Excel, such as Python or R. I was looking into ``rexcel`` last summer; this is an add-in for Excel that integrates R. It seemed to be more GUI-based, but it looked interesting. I never got a chance to check it out though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I am looking for Excel integration in Python. I reviewed your video on ``xlrd``, ``xlwt`` and ``xlutils``. After watching it, I was quickly refreshed on your example. As you noted, it seems ``openpyxl`` is the rising package for Excel manipulation in Python. Last time we spoke you also mentioned that Python could be integrated with Excel natively, which I'm sure would make a lot of people very happy. Fingers crossed!\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework submission will be entirely derived from chapter 12 of [*Automate the Boring Stuff*](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter12/) (*AtBS*). The first section will be me working through the book examples, while later I will tackle the questions and suggested problems from the text.\n",

    "Going into this section, I believed ``openpyxl`` was the answer to all programmatic tasks in Excel; however, this is not the case. That is not to say that is not powerful, it is just more useful for repetitive tasks and data cleanup. I believe I will utilize it moving forward; however, VBA will likely still be required at times. Hopefully, the Python-Excel integration kills VBA.\n",

    "My final project is the last submission for this class. It will be an extension of the JV analysis done previously. It will feature a much more robust EDA section with greater analysis. I am not especially interested in building a classification model; the ultimate goal is to understand why JV is so great so consistently. To understand the this, he will need to be compared to other starting pitchers."
